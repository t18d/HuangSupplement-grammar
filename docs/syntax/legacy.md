Hsü (1980: 89) is an early exposition of the 主謂賓定狀補 terminology. The
sources of this approach are (1) word-based analysis of clause structure and (2)
the logic-inspired binary splits of [immediate-constituent analysis](https://www.tonkunstler-on-the-bund.com/research/percival/).

Monolingual scholars such as the authors in Chang tend to employ a modified
version of this chimera, whilst western-trained academics usually ignore it
without further debate.

## The good parts

Although this is a term derived from [predicate(2)](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199675128.001.0001/acref-9780199675128-e-2643),
**predicative** is worth keeping because of the prevalence in Mandarin Chinese
of words which can appear in both attributive and predicative positions.
