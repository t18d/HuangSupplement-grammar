# Asyndetic coordination

[Dictionaries](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/tally/) and Chang §4.4.4.3 give the impression that as a marker of **asyndetic coordination** -等 must be followed by a **numeral classifier**. This is _not_ true; other clues, e.g. 都, can also serve to show that it is an exhaustive enumeration.

**Example:** 比如時間、地點、工具<ins>等</ins>短語都有語序變化問題 (2010)
