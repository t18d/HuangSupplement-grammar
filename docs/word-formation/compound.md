## Morph order

!!! info inline end

    Chao (1994: 33) was speaking as a two-time editor of _Tz'u yüan_ when he
    advocated wordhood for any compound which occurred frequently in texts.

The notion of a compound 'word' (_tz'u_) with fixed constituent order is foreign
to pre-modern Chinese.

As in languages with a free phrasal constituent order, this freedom was
exploited for literary purposes. Han (2019: 75) shows a steady increase in the
pairs of two-morpheme compounds with reversed morphs throughout history, whilst
the data in Chang (2005: 88) confirms Yü's (1983\[1953]: 791–2) theory that
there was a consistent preference (70.5%) for ordering morphs by the four tones.

## Disambiguation

A less well-known purpose of compounds of synonyms was to remove the lexical
ambiguity of polysemous words (Chao 1994: 33).

## Ionisation

This is the colloquial phenomenon of a lexeme being realised by two words, each
of which has its own syntactic behaviour.

Much energy was wasted in the past on
[ahistorical](../preliminaries/synchronic.md) explanations. Ch'ü (2021) is a
step in the right direction, and Wang and Wang (2020) have shown how much work
remains to be done.

!!! warning

    Experiment 1 in Han et al. (2024) tested the subjects' analytical skills, not
    their intuition. It'd have been far better to ask how many _words_ they saw in
    each expression.

    Yeh and P'an (2018) only has entertainment value.
