# Clitic and adposition

Huang–Shih §13.5, unable to analyse -上, resort to ill-defined fudges of
particle and 'localiser'. -上 is an enclitic just like 在- is a proclitic, and
can be used with or without a proclitic in abstract expressions.

    (在/於)理論上

The term 'preposition' may be usefully kept. Enclitics such as -上 should then
be called 'postpositions'.
