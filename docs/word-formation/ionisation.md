This is the colloquial phenomenon of a lexeme being realised by two words, each
of which has its own syntactic behaviour.

Much energy was wasted in the past on
[ahistorical](../preliminaries/synchronic.md) explanations. Ch'ü (2021) is a
step in the right direction, and Wang and Wang (2020) have shown how much work
remains to be done.

!!! warning

    Experiment 1 in Han et al. (2024) tested the subjects' analytical skills, not
    their intuition. It'd have been far better to ask how many _words_ they saw in
    each expression.

    Yeh and P'an (2018) only has entertainment value.
