# True descriptivism

??? note "Bibliography"

    R. M. W. Dixon, 'The Semantics of Clause Linking in Typological Perspective', in _The Semantics of Clause Linking: A Cross-linguistic Typology_ (Oxford, 2009), 1–55.  
    ⸻, _A Semantic Approach to English Grammar_ (2nd edn, Oxford, 2005).

It's customary today for grammarians to pay lip service to descriptivism and
then seek refuge in an ill-defined 'standard language'.

!!! example

    CGEL, for instance, describes it as the dialect 'used for public information
    announcements, newscasts, commentaries to broadcasts of national events …
    confirmed by the writing found in magazines, newspapers, novels, and non-fiction
    books; by the editing and correcting that is done by the publishers of these;
    and by the way writers for the most part accept such editing and correcting of
    their work' and goes on to pounce on 'usage manuals', as if the editorial process
    all these genres have to go through isn't prescriptive enough.

What's actually found in grammars is usually the **edited version** of the
wriiten language and of **written simulation** of the spoken language. Since the
vast majority of written and spoken material produced by native speakers doesn't
undergo professional editing, such grammars do _not_ reflect the usage of most
speakers.

!!! warning

    The danger of true descriptivism is shown by Chang, a grammar which makes
    copious use of unedited material: much of what one will find there is no longer
    acceptable in educated speech, rendering it a description of period usage.

## Self-editing

Dixon (2009: 51) doesn't hesitate to use _however_ as a conjunction in a
typological work:

> I was only six years old, however I do remember it well.

but switches to the more 'correct' adverb in Dixon (2005: 390), a book on
English grammar:

> John had voted Labour; however, his brother had voted Conservative
