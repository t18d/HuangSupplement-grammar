# Zero-derived verbs (classical)

??? note "Bibliography"

In the classical language, verbs can be derived from other word classes with
zero marking as a stylistic device.

Yüan (1746: 33) was the first to observe that such verbs cannot be understood
when taken out of context. Meng (2017: 388) gives examples from the _Tso chuan_
showing the variety of meanings these verbs can take on even in a single text.

Whether a derived verb became established in the language depends largely on the
literary reputation of the author.

!!! warning

    Much of previous scholarship, conveniently summarised in Yang (2016), builds on
    a misunderstanding of the term 'synthetic'.
    [Synthetic(1)](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199675128.001.0001/acref-9780199675128-e-3333)
    describes the fact that some grammatical category is _realised_ morphologically.
