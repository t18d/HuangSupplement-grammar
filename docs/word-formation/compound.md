## Morph order

!!! info inline end

    Chao (1994: 33) was speaking as a two-time editor of _Tz'u yüan_ when he
    advocated wordhood for any compound which occurred frequently in texts.

The notion of a compound 'word' (_tz'u_) with fixed constituent order is foreign
to pre-modern Chinese.

As in languages with a free phrasal constituent order, this freedom was
exploited for literary purposes. Han (2019: 75) shows a steady increase in the
pairs of two-morpheme compounds with reversed morphs throughout history, whilst
the data in Chang (2005: 88) confirms Yü's (1983\[1953]: 791–2) theory that
there was a consistent preference (70.5%) for ordering morphs by the four tones.

## Compounds of synonyms

A less well-known function of compounds of synonyms was to remove the lexical
ambiguity of polysemous words (Chao 1994: 33).

!!! warning

    Yang (2010: 33) raises the possibility of using 互注 as evidence for the
    semantic equivalence of such synonyms, but sets the bar too low. For the
    equivalence to obtain, they have to be interchangeable as lemma _and_ gloss
    in the writings of the _same_ commentator.

    In the case of 制, he also misquotes Cheng Hsüan, who wrote 制法度 in
    his _Li chi_ commentary.

## Allusive compounds

Allen (2008) is the standard work on the origins of allusive phrases in the
lingua franca. Chi (2013) lays the ground for an etymological dictionary of the
allusive compounds in Chinese.

## Ionisation

This is the colloquial phenomenon of a lexeme being realised by two words, each
of which has its own syntactic behaviour.

Much energy was wasted in the past on
[ahistorical](../preliminaries/synchronic.md) explanations. Ch'ü (2021) is a
step in the right direction, and Wang and Wang (2020) have shown how much work
remains to be done.

!!! warning

    Experiment 1 in Han et al. (2024) tested the subjects' analytical skills, not
    their intuition. It'd have been far better to ask how many _words_ they saw in
    each expression.

    Yeh and P'an (2018) only has entertainment value.
