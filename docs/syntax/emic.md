The consequences of a failure to distinguish between **morphs** and **morphemes** are of two kinds:

1. By using the term _morpheme_ when they really mean a _morph_, one can like
Huang–Shi miss a whole phenomenon like [**orthographic alternation**](../word-formation/orthographic-alternation.md).
2. By not grasping the difference between **abstract units** and their physical **realisation**, one can fall prey to irrelevant concepts such as _erh tzu tz'u_ and _shuang yin chieh tz'u_ which describe **orthography** and **pronunciation** respectively.
