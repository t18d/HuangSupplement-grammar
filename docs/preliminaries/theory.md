# Theoretical framework

Theorists rarely convince each other. The reasons are follows:

1. Synchronic theories are based on a priori assumptions. When a grammar doesn't
serve a practical purpose, competing theories can be equally good.

2. Even native speakers regularly miss counterexamples which invalidate a
generalisation.

3. Academic promotion doesn't require contributing to the continued refinement
of basic linguistic theory.

When it comes to lexicography, however, a grammatical description shouldn't
upset **the user's intuitions** about the language. In practice, this means an
understanding of the structure of Mandarin Chinese which is heavily influenced
by the grammar of English, the **lingua franca**.

It's for this reason that we follow Huang–Shih in adopting a CGEL-like
framework, whilst (unlike them) remaining oriented towards the general
typological theory.

## What's 'cross-linguistic'?

Monolingual grammarians sometimes understand the term to mean they should look
for a feature in several other languages, and if it's described in the same way
there, they feel satisfied that they've reached the correct analysis for
Mandarin Chinese. That's merely [comparative linguistics(2)](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199675128.001.0001/acref-9780199675128-e-588).
