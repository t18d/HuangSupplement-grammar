# Synchronic vs diachronic

??? note "Bibliography"

    孟昭連, 之乎者也非口語論 (Nanking, 2017).  
    完權, '從「的」到「之」', in「的」的性質與功能 (rev. edn, Peking, 2018), 165–90.

Synchronic description is possible only in the narrow sense of
'descriptive'. Language being a living object, any rational **explanation** of a 
linguistic phenomenon has to be a historical one.

The corollary is that to explain any grammatical structure in a language at
a given point in time, one needs to study the evidence in the previous several
hundred years _for all related structures_ in chronological order. Any theory
drawn from a snapshot at one point in time alone is a mere fantasy with no basis
in reality.

!!! example

    Wan (2018) compares -的 and -之 from discontinuous periods when he
    should have examined Republican sources where both were used side by side.
    Meng (2017) also appeared too late to allow an accurate understanding of
    -之.
