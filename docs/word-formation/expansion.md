# False tests

**Expansion**-based tests are _not_ a reliable tool for distinguishing between
syntactic constructions and **compounds**. Their operation ultimately depends on
knowledge of semantic content and orthographic conventions. Under the delusion
that syntactic rules are **innate**, however, faulty lexical analysis is often
used to explain away conflicting evidence.

!!! example

    A matchbox is _not_ a box for matches (CGEL §14.4), but one in which matches are
    sold, with a striking surface on one side; 羊肉 is _not_ equivalent to 羊的肉
    (Chang: 277), but flesh of sheep used as food.
