# Get started

This appendix fixes various issues in Huang–Shih (2016) so that the quotations
found in the Supplement can be adequately described in a CGEL-like framework.
The analysis here aims to be test-driven rather than translation-driven.

The following works are regularly cited:

- Huang Chu-ren and Shih Ting-hsü (eds), _A Reference Grammar of Chinese_
  (Cambridge, 2016).
- Chang Pin (ed), _Hsien tai han yü miao hsieh yü fa_ (Peking, 2010).
