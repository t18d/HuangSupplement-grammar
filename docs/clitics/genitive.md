# -的: genitive of the sphere

??? note "Bibliography"

    Harm Pinkster, _The Oxford Latin Syntax_, i (Oxford, 2015).  
    完權,「的」的性質與功能 (rev. edn, Peking, 2018).  
    Joshua Whatmough, 'Grammatica quaedam', _The Phoenix_, 2/3 (1948), 65–72.

-的 is a genitive enclitic. It can attach to a core or peripheral argument, or
to a modifier within an NP.

The most insightful paper to date on the genitive case is Whatmough (1948).
Scholars like Pinkster (2015: 1223), by constrast, mistook the history of
grammatical labels for the history of grammar, oblivious to the fact that Latin
had only _one_ genitive.

!!! info

    The history of grammatical labels remains to be written. For now, see the
    [Historicised Grammar](https://github.com/t18d/historicised-grammar)
    project.

!!! warning

    Wan's (2018: 213) definition of -的 as a referent marker which enhances the
    (cognitive) salience of the referent is a fudge.
