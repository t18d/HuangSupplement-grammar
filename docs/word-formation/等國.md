# -等國

Huang–Shi §3.5.1.1:

> 英法等國 … 'countries like England and France.' … a case of conventionalized contextual ellipsis.

Both the gloss and the analysis are wrong. They illustrate some of the commonest pitfalls in **synchronic** analysis:

1. The **elided** part must be unambiguously specified.
2. No attention is paid to **paradigmatic alternants** like -等地, where a **semantically equivalent** full form is not in use. Cf. 英法等國 _vs_ 英法等國家 with 台北上海等地 _vs_ <sup>#</sup>台北上海等地區 _vs_ <sup>#</sup>台北上海等地方 _vs_ 台北上海等城市.
3. No attention is paid to more established alternants such as 各國 (1602) and 各地 (1822), from which -等國 and -等地 are created **by analogy**.

英法等國 should be glossed as 'Britain and France' (等 as marker of [**asyndetic coordination**](#asyndetic-coordination)) or 'Britain, France and other countries' (等 as **abbreviatory device**).
