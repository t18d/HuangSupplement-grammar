# Periodisation

Old Chinese and Middle Chinese, like Baroque, are terms that one could wish by
now universally discredited. It may be recalled that Karlgren's [**Ancient**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/dictionary/#chinese-ancient)
and [**Archaic Chinese**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/dictionary/#chinese-archaic)
were never intended for [**periodisation**](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/dictionary/#periodisation-linguistic).

Use a date, date range or political period.
