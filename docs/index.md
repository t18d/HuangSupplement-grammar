# Get started

This appendix fixes various issues in Huang–Shih so that the quotations cited
in [the Supplement](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/) can be adequately
described in a CGEL-like framework. The analysis here aims to be test-driven
rather than translation-driven.

The following works are cited by abbreviations:
