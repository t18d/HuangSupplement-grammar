# Morph vs morpheme

The upshot of the failure to distinguish between **morph** and **morpheme**
is:

1. By using the term _morpheme_ when morph is meant, one can (like
Huang–Shih) miss a phenomenon like [orthographic alternation](../word-formation/orthographic-alternation.md).

3. By not grasping the difference between abstract units and their physical
**realisation**, one can fall prey to sloppy terminology such as 二字詞 (which
describes orthography without regard to the actual number of morphemes) and
雙音節詞 (which sows confusion about **phonological word**).
