# Advice to a young grammarian

_My dear Sir_  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_If you ever find yourself adding an English gloss
in parentheses after technical terms, chances are you're addressing the wrong
audience. Your Englishless reader will think you're trying too hard to impress,
whilst someone who's mastered English will remember you for the typos in your
gloss (for it's more often than not the monolingual writers that indulge in
glosses). Rewrite your paper and send it to an English-language journal._
