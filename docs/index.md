# Get started

This appendix fixes various issues in Huang–Shih so that the quotations cited
in [the Supplement](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/) can be adequately
described in a CGEL-like framework. The analysis here aims to be test-driven
rather than translation-driven.

The following works are cited regularly:

`Huang–Shih`

:   Huang Chu-ren and Shih Ting-hsü (eds), _A Reference Grammar of Chinese_
  (Cambridge, 2016).

`Chang`

:   Chang Pin (ed.), _Hsien tai han yü miao hsieh yü fa_ (Peking, 2010).
