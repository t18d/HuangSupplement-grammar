# What's educated Mandarin?

??? note "Bibliography"

Consider the following expressions:

1.  表彰勞模[^1]大會
2.  招收研究生辦法
3.  審查資格小組
4.  保護熊貓組織

[^1]: 勞模 is a sort of honours list distributed by communists.

Any competent editor would immediately correct them to:

1.  勞模表彰大會
2.  研究生招收辦法
3.  資格審查小組 or 來審查資格的小組
4.  熊貓保護組織

And yet both Yin (a native of Taiyüan) and Teng (who's based in Hong Kong)
accepted the first version without a qualm. Examples like these abound in
today's grammatical scholarship.

The variety of Mandarin described here is one which, if used in Shanghai, won't
associate the speaker[^2] with any specific areas of China or educational
background.

[^2]: Which subsumes 'writer'.
