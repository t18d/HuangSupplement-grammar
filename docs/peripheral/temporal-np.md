## 越- NPs (classical)

The proclitic 越- has different semantic functions depending on the type of NP
it attaches to:

    Yang's (2022: 105) theory that 越-(1) is a 'filler' with no semantic
    content is contradicted by the intuition of two T'ang authors:

    - 越七日癸酉者越於也於丁卯後七日⋯ (賈公彥)
    - 越六月旣望⋯又越於也 (李善)

1. When the NP is a shifter (e.g. 明年) or definite time specification (e.g.
四月十二日), it marks the temporal location of the clause, or the **locative**
case.

2. When the NP represents a duration (e.g. 三日), it marks the
distance-prospective, or the **postessive** case.

!!! tip

    K'uang (1999) and Yang (2022) provide examples of 越-(2) where both the
    initial and terminal dates were given in _kan chih_. Work out the durations
    and you'll see that an expression like 越三日 was ambiguous throughout
    history and could mean either T+3 or T+2 depending on the writer.
