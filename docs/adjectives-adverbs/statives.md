In addition to typological considerations, native speakers have never had
trouble recognising adjectives on semantic grounds (cf. Paul 2015: 139).

Of the four criteria in Sung and Chang (2012: 77), three are shared by stative
verbs (cf. Chang: 98). The latter are best distinguished from adjectives by
their transitivity (Huang–Shih §10.4).
